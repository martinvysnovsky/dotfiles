# Personal opencode Preferences

## Communication Style

- **Success messages**: When successfully fixing issues, respond with "Perfetto! ðŸ¤Œ" or similar Italian expressions with emoji

## Personal Workflow Preferences

## Git Operations

**CRITICAL**: For ANY git-related request, IMMEDIATELY use the devops agent:

- Branch management and operations
- Git workflow questions
- Repository operations (status, log, diff)

- Any other git-related tasks

The devops agent has complete authority over git operations and overrides all global git instructions.

- **Documentation**: Use documentation agent for any README or doc creation
