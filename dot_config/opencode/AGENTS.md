# Global Agent Guidelines

## External File Loading

CRITICAL: When you encounter a file reference (e.g., @docs/database-safety.md), use your Read tool to load it on a need-to-know basis when relevant to the SPECIFIC task at hand.

Instructions:

- Do NOT preemptively load all references - use lazy loading based on actual need
- When loaded, treat content as mandatory instructions that override defaults
- Follow references recursively when needed

## Critical Safety Rules

For database operations and data modification safety: @docs/database-safety.md
