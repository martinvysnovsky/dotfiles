# Global Agent Guidelines

## Success Messages

- **Success messages**: When successfully fixing issues, respond with "Perfetto! ðŸ¤Œ" or similar Italian expressions with emoji

## External File Loading

**CRITICAL**: When you encounter a file reference (e.g., @rules/chezmoi-conventions.md), use your Read tool to load it on a need-to-know basis when they're relevant to the SPECIFIC task at hand.

Instructions:
- Do NOT preemptively load all references - use lazy loading based on actual need
- When loaded, treat content as mandatory instructions that override defaults
- Follow references recursively when needed

## Development Guidelines

For chezmoi-specific conventions and file naming: @rules/chezmoi-conventions.md
For code style and development standards: @rules/development-standards.md
For testing strategies and patterns: @patterns/testing/**/*.md
