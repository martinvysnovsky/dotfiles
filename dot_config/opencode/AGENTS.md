# Global Agent Guidelines

## Meta Guidelines

- **Proactive Documentation**: When discovering new coding patterns, conventions, or rules during conversations, proactively update either this local AGENTS.md file or the global AGENTS.md file to preserve institutional knowledge for future sessions
- **Rule Discovery**: If a user establishes a new coding standard, preference, or workflow during a conversation, immediately document it in the appropriate AGENTS.md file
- **Knowledge Preservation**: Treat AGENTS.md files as living documents that should evolve with each conversation to capture learned best practices
